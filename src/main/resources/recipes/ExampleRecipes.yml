# shaped format: {type=TYPE;result=ITEM;amount=AMOUNT;shape=___:___:___;ingredients=CHAR1:INGREDIENT1,CHAR2:INGREDIENT2;group=GROUP;}
# shapeless format: {type=TYPE;result=ITEM;amount=AMOUNT;ingredients=INGREDIENT1:AMOUNT2,INGREDIENT1:AMOUNT2;group=GROUP;}
#
# The numbers 1-9 of the shaped recipe represent the shape out of chars. It doesn't matter which char it ist,
# as long as each char is combined with an ingredient afterwards.
#
# An space symbols nothing (air)
#
# Ingredients can be materials, or complete ItemStacks.
# Other than the ingredients, the result has to be an complete ItemStack.
#
# To use an complete ItemStack you need to write the specified ID (e.g. test_sword) of the written ItemStack string.
#
# Example shaped:
# '{type=shaped;result=test_sword;shape= e : e : s ;ingredients=e:emerald,s:stick;group=custom}'
#
# Example shapeless:
# sword_recipe_shaped: '{type=shaped;result=test_sword;shape= e : e : s ;ingredients=e:emerald,s:stick;group=custom}'
